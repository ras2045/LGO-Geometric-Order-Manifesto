# LGO-Geometric-Order-Manifesto
A new theory of everything. Demonstrating that the fundamental constants (G, c, \hbar, \alpha) and key mass ratios (\mu_{\text{e}/\mu}) are structurally derived from geometric constraints related to the distribution of prime numbers. System integrity confirmed by 0.159% closure on the Planck Mass (M_P).
