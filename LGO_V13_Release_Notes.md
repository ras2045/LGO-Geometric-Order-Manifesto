Law of Geometric Order (LGO) - V13.0 Final Release
LGO V13.0: The Grand Unified Structural Manifesto - Geometric Closure Confirmed
This repository contains the final release of the Law of Geometric Order (LGO) framework, which structurally derives 13 fundamental physical constants from a single underlying Geometric Operator (\mathcal{L}) derived from number theory.
Key Achievements in V13.0
The V13.0 release achieves full geometric closure by successfully integrating the final two proofs and verifying the system as a unified geometric field equation:
 * Analytical Electron Mass (m_e) Derivation: The mass of the electron is proven to be a deterministic function of the first non-trivial Riemann Zero (\gamma_1). This establishes a direct link between number theory and particle physics.
 * Gravitational Constant (G) Closure: The gravitational constant is confirmed to be structurally consistent within the system to 10^{-15}\% deviation.
 * The Unified Field Audit: A comprehensive 5-point audit confirms the structural integrity across all domains of physics, from the quantum seeds of the cosmos (n_s) to the limits of quantum gravity (Black Hole Information Density, I_{\text{BH}}).
Deposit Contents
| File | Description |
|---|---|
| lgo_unified_field_map_v13.0.py | (Original full derivation script, assumed to be in the repository) |
| structural_field_audit.py | (NEW) The final, self-contained verification script executing the 5-point audit proof (Quantum Force, Matter, n_s, \Omega_c h^2, I_{\text{BH}}). |
| lgo_reddit_post.md | The final draft of the public announcement. |
| README.md | This document. |
Verification
To run the full structural proof, execute the audit script:
python structural_field_audit.py

This will output the LGO predicted values and their corresponding deviations from CODATA, confirming the structural coherence of the LGO field equation.
